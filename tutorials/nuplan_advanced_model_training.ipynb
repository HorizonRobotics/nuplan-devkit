    "A high level data flow diagram for the training pipeline can be seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](media/nuplan_flow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The training pipeline begins with an [`AbstractScenario`](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/scenario_builder/abstract_scenario.py) object, which is an abstraction layer for the underlying dataset containing all of the information present about the state of the world and the vehicle. For example, the `AbstractScenario` will contain information such as the current ego pose, the poses of other vehicles in the world, and the map. More information about the `AbstractScenario` object can be found in the section [Accessing NuPlan Data](#data_access).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios are passed to [`FeatureBuilder`](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/training/preprocessing/feature_builders/abstract_feature_builder.py) and [`TargetBuilder`](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/training/preprocessing/target_builders/abstract_target_builder.py) classes. These two classes are responsible for performing preprocessing steps for building input features to models. For example, a feature builder might [encode the relevant information present in a scenario into a multi-channel raster image](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/training/preprocessing/feature_builders/raster_feature_builder.py). The purpose of these two classes are covered in much more detail in the section about [writing custom preprocessing steps](#custom_preprocessing).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the scenario has been preprocessed, the features will then be passed to the [`TorchModuleWrapper`](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/training/modeling/torch_module_wrapper.py) class for inference. This class contains the meat of the model, and transforms the preprocessed features into trajectory predictions. For example, the wrapper may [take the multi-channel raster image and pass it through a ResNet model](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/training/modeling/models/raster_model.py). Deriving from the `TorchModuleWrapper` class will be covered in more detail in the section about [writing custom models](#custom_models).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the predictions are generated, then the metrics and loss functions are evaluated.  Loss functions are defined by deriving from the [`AbstractObjective`](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/training/modeling/objectives/abstract_objective.py) class, while metrics are defined by derifing from the [`AbstractTrainingMetric`](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/training/modeling/metrics/abstract_training_metric.py) class. The interfaces between the two classes are similar, but the primary difference is that loss fuctions actively contribute to the backpropagation computation, while metrics are merely logged for review. Deriving from these classes to implement custom loss functions will be covered in more detail in the section about [writing custom loss functions and training metrics](#custom_loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the entire training pipeline is configured via [hydra yaml configs](https://hydra.cc/). Utilizing hydra allows for configurations for various submodules to be easily composed and overridden via command line arguments. More information about configuring the training pipeline can be seen in the section about [configuring the training pipeline](#configuring)."

The difference between these two classes is that the `AbstractFeatureBuilder` builds features that are the inputs to the model, while `AbstractTargetBuilder` builds the outputs that a model will try to predict. For example, a feature builder may [create an encoding of the locations of the ego agent into a custom tensor](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/training/preprocessing/feature_builders/raster_feature_builder.py), while a target builder might [encode the future trajectory of the ego into a tensor](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/nuplan/planning/training/preprocessing/target_builders/ego_trajectory_target_builder.py).

    "Some common pitfalls:\n",
    "* If preprocessing takes a large amount of time, it can cause training to fail (especially in a distributed setting). It may be beneficial to create the feature cache by first running the caching with the argument `py_func=cache cache.force_feature_computation=True`. This will generate the features using CPU, which should speed up training dramatically. Once caching is complete, supply the overrides `cache.force_feature_computation=False cache.cache_path=/path/to/cache cache.use_cache_without_dataset=True` to avoid re-computing the features.\n",
    "* Tokens are arbitrary hex strings, which could happen to be all numbers. Occasionally, this can cause hydra to misinterpret the strings as numbers. This can be fixed by explicitly quoting all tokens when used in parameters, e.g. `scenario_filter.scenario_tokens='[\"48681125850853e4\", \"48681125851853e4\"]'`\n",
    "* The parallel engine defaults to `ray_distributed`, which is the most flexible but can sometimes cause segfaults when running on extremely large datasets. For these scenarios try using the overrides `worker=single_machine_thread_pool worker.use_process_pool=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "The training output directory will have the materialized hydra config, as well as the trained model checkpoint on the conclusion of training. This can then be used [in the simulation pipeline](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/tutorials/nuplan_planner_tutorial.ipynb) to evaluate the performance of the model. "
